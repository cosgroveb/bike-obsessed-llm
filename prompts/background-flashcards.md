Please generate 10 markdown flashcards from the following text about what you have taught me so far, suitable for use with the `mdfc` command-line tool.

Place the flashcards in ./flashcards/

Each flashcard should be presented as a first-level heading (`#`) followed by the question, a horizontal rule (`---`), and then the answer, like so:

# Question
---
Answer

Focus on creating questions that test key concepts, definitions, and important details. Ensure the answers are concise and to the point. Group related flashcards under appropriate categories using first-level headings in the markdown file, as supported by `mdfc`.

If the topic is code, link to examples of this code on Github. Use the gh cli to search. Give hyperlinks to actual examples.
